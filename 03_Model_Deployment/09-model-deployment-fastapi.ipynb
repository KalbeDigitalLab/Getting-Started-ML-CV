    "# Machine Learning Deployment using FastAPI\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section, w've learned how to quickly deploy machine learning models with an interactive interface using Gradio. It's fast and easy to build and deploy machine learning prototype for other poeple to try. But most of the time in production, we need different kind of user interface that has more flexibility and functionality or maybe we want to integrate the model to our existin interface. In this situation, we may have to decouple our machine learning model with the interface itself. We can focus more on the deploying machine learning models and find a way to let other services communicate to our model.\n",

    "A web framework is a software package or library that provides a structured and standardized way to build web applications. It typically offers a collection of tools, components, and abstractions that simplify common web development tasks, such as handling HTTP requests, managing routing, interacting with databases, and generating HTML or other types of responses.\n",

    "How do to services communicate with each other? They're using an Application Programming Interface. Application Programming Interfaces (or APIs for short) have been around for a long time and basically provide a standardized way of communication between two software applications that are not necessarily of the same type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applied to our context of data science, an API allows for the communication between a web page or app and your AI application. The API opens up certain user-defined URL endpoints, which can be used to send or receive requests with data. These endpoints are not dependent on the application: if you update your algorithm, the interface will stay the same. This minimizes the work required to update the running application.\n",

    "## FastAPI Web Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) with Python. It is **designed to be fast, easy to use, and highly efficient**, making it a popular choice for developing web applications and microservices.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main features of FastAPI is its ability to **generate highly efficient code** by leveraging the type annotations introduced in Python 3.6 and above. By using type hints, **FastAPI can automatically validate data, handle request and response serialization**, and generate interactive API documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "While FastAPI is a popular choice for deploying machine learning models, it's important to note that **there are several other frameworks and tools available** for deploying ML models, and the choice ultimately **depends on your specific requirements and preferences**. However, FastAPI does offer several advantages that make it a recommended option in many cases. Here are some reasons why professionals often suggest using FastAPI for deploying machine learning models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Performance**: FastAPI is known for its high performance and low latency. It leverages asynchronous programming techniques and supports asynchronous libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch, making it suitable for handling computationally intensive ML tasks efficiently. This can be crucial, especially when dealing with real-time or high-throughput applications.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Integration with ML libraries**: FastAPI integrates seamlessly with popular Python ML libraries and frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and more. This makes it easy to incorporate your trained ML models into the API and leverage the rich functionality provided by these libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Type annotations and validation**: FastAPI utilizes Python's type annotations to automatically serialize and validate request and response data. This ensures that the input data provided to your ML models is in the expected format, reducing the chances of errors and improving the overall reliability of your API.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interactive documentation**: FastAPI automatically generates detailed API documentation, including information about endpoints, input/output data types, and request/response examples. This documentation is interactive and helps developers and users understand and interact with your ML API more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalability and concurrency**: FastAPI is designed to handle high levels of concurrency and can efficiently serve multiple API requests simultaneously. This is beneficial when deploying ML models that require handling multiple requests concurrently, especially in scenarios with high traffic or real-time predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deployment options**: FastAPI can be easily deployed on various platforms, including cloud services and containerization technologies like Docker. It provides flexibility in choosing the deployment option that best suits your needs, whether it's deploying on-premises or in the cloud.\n"

    "### Sending Data over API\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://uploads.sitepoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1661749125REST-API-Request.png\" width=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "When sending data over HTTP, there are several ways to include the data in the request:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Query Parameters**: Data can be sent as part of the URL query parameters. This method is commonly used in GET requests, where the data is appended to the URL in a key-value format. Query parameters are limited in size and may not be suitable for sending large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Request Body**: Data can be sent in the body of the HTTP request. This is typically done using methods like POST, PUT, and PATCH. The request body can contain various data formats, such as JSON, XML, or form data. This method allows for sending larger amounts of data and is more flexible in terms of the data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Headers**: Data can also be included in the request headers. Headers are used to provide additional information about the request, and certain headers can be used to send data, such as authentication tokens or metadata. However, headers have limitations on the amount of data they can carry, and they may not be suitable for sending large payloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "When choosing how to send data over HTTP, there are tradeoffs to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Size and Performance**: Sending data in query parameters may be suitable for small amounts of data but can become impractical for larger payloads. Sending large amounts of data in the request body allows for more flexibility, but it may impact performance due to increased payload size and longer transfer times.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Security**: Depending on the nature of the data, its sensitivity, and the communication requirements, different methods may have varying security implications. For example, sending sensitive data as part of the URL query parameters may expose it in server logs or browser history, while sending it in the request body allows for better confidentiality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encoding and Parsing**: Different data formats require proper encoding and parsing on both the client and server sides. Ensure compatibility between the client and server in terms of data format and handling to avoid issues with data integrity or interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Server Constraints and API Design**: Consider the capabilities and constraints of the server and any limitations imposed by the API design. For example, some servers may have restrictions on the size of the request body or the maximum length of query parameters.\n",

    "- **Loading the ONNX Model**: The ONNX model is loaded using ONNX Runtime (`ort.InferenceSession`). The path to the model file is provided as a parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Preprocessing Function**: The `preprocess_image` function takes an input image and applies the defined transformation pipeline. The image is transposed, expanded, and returned as a preprocessed image.\n",

    "- **Image Decoding and Preprocessing**: The `classify_image` function decodes the base64 image string using `base64.b64decode` and `cv2.imdecode`. It checks if the image is valid and if not, returns dummy data. If the image is valid, it preprocesses the image using the preprocess_image function.\n",

    "- **Running Inference**: The preprocessed image is passed to the ONNX model using `model.run`. The output predictions are retrieved and stored in the prediction variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Postprocessing**: The prediction scores are postprocessed by applying the softmax function to normalize the output probabilities. The class names and corresponding scores are combined into a dictionary, labeled_result, where the class name is the key and the score is the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Returning the Result**: The labeled_result dictionary is returned as the response from the `/classify endpoint`.\n",
